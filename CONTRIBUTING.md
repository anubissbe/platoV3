git clone https://git.euraika.net/Bert/plato.git
cd plato

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run development mode
npm run dev
```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test

   # Type checking
   npm run typecheck

   # Linting
   npm run lint

   # Format code
   npm run fmt
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format:
     - `feat:` for new features
     - `fix:` for bug fixes
     - `docs:` for documentation
     - `test:` for test additions/changes
     - `refactor:` for code refactoring
     - `perf:` for performance improvements
     - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. **Push and create a merge request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces over type aliases where appropriate

### React/Ink Components

- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add proper TypeScript props interfaces

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update CLAUDE.md for AI-specific guidance
- Include inline comments for complex logic
