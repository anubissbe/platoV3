# Verification Guide (Copilot + Tool-Bridge)

This guide walks through logging into Copilot and validating the end-to-end tool-call bridge with a mock MCP server.

Prereqs

- Node.js 18+
- `npm ci`

1. Start Plato

- `npm run dev`
- In the TUI, run `/doctor` to confirm basic checks.

2. Login with Copilot

- In the TUI, run `/login` and follow the device code instructions.
- Re-run `/doctor` — you should see `copilot auth — <your-username>`.

3. Start a Mock MCP Server

- In a separate terminal: `npx tsx scripts/mock-mcp.ts`
- In the TUI: `/mcp attach local http://localhost:8719`
- Optional: `/mcp tools` should list `echo` and `sum`.

4. Ensure Tool-Call Preset is Enabled

- `/tool-call-preset status` (enabled by default)
- If disabled: `/tool-call-preset on`
- Strict mode is fine: `/tool-call-preset strict on`

5. Claude-style Writes (Parity)

- Ensure parity mode: `/permissions default fs_patch allow` then `/apply-mode auto`.
- Ask: `make a file called hello.py and insert hello world code in python into it`
- You should see:

```
● Write(hello.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to hello.py
     print("Hello, World!")

● Done! Created hello.py with a Hello World program.
```

6. Patch Engine Check (optional)

- In a non-git folder, `/apply` will fail with a clear message.
- In a git repo, diffs proposed by the assistant can be previewed via `/diff` then applied via `/apply`.

7. Proxy Check (optional)

- `/proxy start --port 11434` and then `/proxy stop`.

Notes

- If the assistant doesn’t emit the tool_call JSON, try prompting explicitly: “Output only a fenced json block with a tool_call to local:sum for a=2,b=3”.
- `/tool-call-preset off` disables auto-bridging; `/tool-call-preset on` re-enables it.
