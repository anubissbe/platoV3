# Orchestrator & Turn Loop

## Turn Lifecycle

- Input: user message or `/command`.
- Context build: selected files/diffs, repo status, system prompts, memory, output-style.
- Model call: streaming; tool-use if supported; else ReAct with tool-text responses.
- File writes (Claude parity): when the assistant proposes changes, Plato performs writes immediately ("Write(filename)") after safety and permission checks. Unified diffs are sanitized/used under the hood and recorded for `/revert`.
- Post: update cost/tokens, compact if needed, persist session.

## Streaming & Cancellation

- Stream tokens to TUI; partial diffs buffered until complete hunks.
- Cancellation: Ctrl-C → abort request; best-effort to stop tool exec.
- Backpressure: throttle UI render; chunk large tool outputs.

## Concurrency

- Single active turn; queue subsequent messages; `/resume` restores.
- Background tasks: indexing, embeddings, diagnostics; low priority.

## Output Styles

- Profiles control system prompts and renderers: concise/verbose/code-first/custom.
- Default rendering mirrors Claude Code’s terse action lines (e.g., Write(filename) … Wrote N lines …).
