# Advanced Context Management

## Description

Implement advanced context management capabilities for Plato CLI/TUI that enhance code understanding and provide intelligent file selection through semantic indexing, smart content sampling, and improved context visualization.

## User Stories

### As a developer working on large codebases

- I want Plato to intelligently understand which files are most relevant to my current task
- I want semantic search capabilities that go beyond keyword matching
- I want context suggestions based on code relationships and dependencies
- I want to see how my context budget is being utilized effectively

### As a developer working with complex projects

- I want Plato to automatically include related files when I reference a component or function
- I want intelligent sampling that shows the most important parts of large files
- I want context to persist across sessions with smart resumption
- I want visual indicators for context quality and completeness

### As a developer optimizing productivity

- I want context management to be proactive rather than reactive
- I want smart defaults that reduce manual context configuration
- I want performance optimizations that make context operations fast
- I want integration with existing Plato workflows and commands

## Scope

### In Scope

- **Semantic Indexing System**: Build lightweight semantic understanding of codebase
- **Intelligent File Selection**: Algorithm to automatically suggest relevant files
- **Smart Content Sampling**: Extract meaningful code snippets with proper context
- **Enhanced Context Visualization**: Improved `/context` command with rich display
- **Context Budget Optimization**: Advanced token management and allocation
- **Session-Aware Context**: Persist context decisions across Plato sessions
- **Integration Points**: Connect with existing `/add-dir`, `/context`, MCP tools

### Out of Scope

- Full language server protocol (LSP) integration
- Real-time file watching and incremental indexing
- Advanced AI-powered code completion
- Integration with external IDE extensions
- Database storage for semantic indexes

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Semantic Indexing Engine

- Lightweight file analysis and relationship mapping
- Symbol extraction and cross-reference tracking
- Import/dependency graph construction
- Configurable indexing depth and scope

### 2. Intelligent Selection Algorithm

- Context-aware file relevance scoring
- Automatic related file discovery
- Smart sampling for large files
- Integration with user preferences and history

### 3. Enhanced Context Management UI

- Rich visualization in `/context` command
- Interactive selection and deselection
- Context budget breakdown and optimization suggestions
- Visual indicators for file relevance and completeness

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Fast indexing with incremental updates
- Efficient storage and retrieval
- Lazy loading and caching strategies
- Background processing for large projects

### 5. Session Integration

- Context persistence across sessions
- Smart context resumption
- Integration with existing Plato memory system
- Export/import capabilities for context configurations

## Success Criteria

### User Experience

- Developers can find relevant files 3x faster than manual selection
- Context setup time reduced by 60% through intelligent defaults
- Context quality improved with 90%+ relevant file inclusion
- Zero-configuration experience for common development workflows

### Technical Performance

- Semantic indexing completes in <30 seconds for codebases up to 50K files
- File relevance scoring executes in <200ms for typical queries
- Memory usage stays under 100MB for index storage
- Context operations maintain sub-second response times

### Integration Quality

- Seamless integration with existing `/context`, `/add-dir` commands
- Compatible with all MCP server integrations
- Works across all supported programming languages
- Maintains Plato's existing session persistence model

## Non-Goals

- Replace existing manual context controls (they remain available)
- Implement full IDE-level semantic analysis
- Provide real-time collaborative context sharing
- Create dependency on external semantic analysis services

## Dependencies

- Existing Plato context management system (`src/context/`)
- File indexing infrastructure (`docs/context/indexing.md`)
- Session persistence system (`.plato/session.json`)
- MCP integration for tool coordination
- React/Ink TUI framework for enhanced visualizations

## Assumptions

- Users work primarily with text-based codebases
- Performance requirements align with local-first philosophy
- Integration maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Semantic analysis can be accomplished with lightweight heuristics rather than full AST parsing
