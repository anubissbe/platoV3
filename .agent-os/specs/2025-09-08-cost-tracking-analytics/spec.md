## Overview

Enhance the existing basic cost tracking with comprehensive analytics and optimization hints to help cost-conscious developers optimize their AI usage and reduce costs through data-driven insights.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Cost-Conscious Developer Daily Optimization**
As a developer working on a tight budget, I want to track my daily AI usage costs so that I can identify expensive conversations and modify my prompting patterns to stay within budget. I need to see real-time cost information in the status line, review daily/weekly trends, and get alerts when conversations are unusually expensive so I can adjust my approach immediately.

**Story 2: Project Manager Client Billing Analysis**
As a project manager, I want to break down AI costs per project/conversation so that I can accurately bill clients and justify AI tool expenses. I need detailed cost breakdowns by project, the ability to export data for invoicing, and historical cost trends to show value delivered over time.

**Story 3: Budget Planning User**
As a user planning my monthly AI budget, I want to understand my usage patterns and costs across different models so that I can make informed decisions about which AI services to use. I need monthly cost summaries, model comparison analytics, and 6-month historical data to identify trends and plan future spending.
